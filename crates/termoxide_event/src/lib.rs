//! # termoxide_event: Terminal input events for TermOxide
//!
//! This crate turns raw terminal input into typed, backend-agnostic
//! [`Event`]s delivered asynchronously over a channel. A background thread
//! reads from the terminal (through `crossterm`), translates each input, and
//! forwards it to the application, which pulls events at its own pace.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! |Type|Role|
//! |------|------|
//! |[`EventStream`]|Handle owning the reader thread|
//! |[`EventStreamConfig`]|Settings a stream starts with, such as mouse reporting|
//! |[`Event`]|A single event (handshake, key press or mouse action) delivered by the stream|
//! |[`KeyEvent`](event::KeyEvent)|A key press: a key code plus its modifiers|
//! |[`KeyCode`](event::KeyCode)|Backend-agnostic key identifier|
//! |[`KeyModifiers`](event::KeyModifiers)|Modifier keys held during a press or a mouse action|
//! |[`MouseEvent`](event::MouseEvent)|A mouse action: a kind, a cell position and its modifiers|
//! |[`MouseEventKind`](event::MouseEventKind)|What the mouse did: button, move or scroll|
//! |[`MouseButton`](event::MouseButton)|Which button a button action involved|
//! |[`Error`] / [`Result`]|Error reported by the reader, and its `Result` alias|
//!
//! Raw mode and mouse reporting are enabled while the stream is alive and both
//! restored when it is dropped, so the terminal is never left in a broken
//! state. Mouse reporting is on by default: while it is on, the terminal stops
//! handling text selection itself, which most terminals still offer with
//! `Shift` held. An application that ignores the mouse can opt out with
//! [`EventStream::with_config`] and
//! [`EventStreamConfig::mouse_capture`].
//!
//! ## Quickstart
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use std::{thread, time::Duration};
//!
//! use termoxide_event::{EventStream, event::Event};
//!
//! let events = EventStream::new();
//!
//! // `poll_events` never blocks: it drains whatever input is pending and
//! // returns an empty `Vec` when nothing is ready, so the loop must set its
//! // own pace. The first event is always `Event::ChannelReady`.
//! 'run: loop {
//!     for event in events.poll_events() {
//!         match event {
//!             Event::ChannelReady => println!("stream ready"),
//!             Event::KeyPress(key) => {
//!                 println!("key pressed: {:?} with {:?}", key.code, key.modifiers);
//!                 break 'run;
//!             },
//!             Event::Mouse(mouse) => {
//!                 println!("mouse {:?} at {}:{}", mouse.kind, mouse.column, mouse.row);
//!             },
//!         }
//!     }
//!     thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(16));
//! }
//!
//! // Stop the reader thread and restore the terminal, surfacing any error the
//! // reader stopped on (including a panic of the reader thread).
//! if let Err(error) = events.teardown() {
//!     eprintln!("reader stopped: {error}");
//! }
//! ```

/// An owning handle over a background terminal-input reader.

/// mode — and, unless opted out, mouse reporting — and streams [`Event`]s back
/// over a channel. The application consumes
/// them with [`poll_events`](Self::poll_events). The very first event is
/// always [`Event::ChannelReady`].
///

/// [`teardown`](Self::teardown)) signals the thread to stop, joins it, and
/// lets it restore the terminal. Thanks to the [`Drop`] implementation this
/// happens even if the handle simply goes out of scope.
